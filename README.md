# Reinforcement-Learning

A series of experiments on OpenAI's gyms that I create as I make my way through Sutton and Barto's 2nd edition RL textbook

-----

What I have so far:

- A few k-armed bandit tests on a randomly generated test bed as described in sutton and barto chapter 2


What is planned:

- MDP methods with approximations, maybe monte carlo methods?
- Using deep neural networks as a policy? (Deep RL)
